## <a name="descriptionlink"></a>Description
The goal of challenge 14 was to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. We were instructed to build this site completely from scratch and deploy it to Heroku. The app  follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

I was able to deploy to Heroku but unfortunately do not have the time to debug the errors before the deadline tonight. However, I am submitting my completed code in the hopes that it can still be graded as is. I understand that I will not be able to receive full credit. I will resolve these issues in the future.
